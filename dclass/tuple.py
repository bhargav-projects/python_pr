''' in tuple parenthasis is optional , len(tuple) is also available 
before index method use member ship operator in that so we dont get error(like value in tuple or not )
#*in list we have sort() fun but not in tuple so in tuple we use sorted ()
In sorted (reverse=True ) for values in reverse and descending order
#* tuple comprehension is not in python  
# if  use () this concept is called generator
we can apply + and * operator for tuple
